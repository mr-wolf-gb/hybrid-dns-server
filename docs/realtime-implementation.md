## Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Connection Management
- **Connection Types**: Different connection types for different monitoring needs
- **Event Filtering**: Clients only receive events they're subscribed to
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- **Message Queuing**: Reliable message delivery with queuing
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management

### Real-time Data Flow
1. **Event Generation**: Backend services generate events for various activities
2. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Events are broadcast to connected clients
3. **Client Processing**: Frontend components receive and process events
4. **UI Updates**: Components update their state and re-render
5. **User Notifications**: Important events trigger toast notifications

### Performance Optimizations
- **Event Throttling**: Prevents overwhelming clients with too many events
- **Selective Updates**: Only relevant components update for specific events
- **Efficient Rendering**: React optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Connection Management**: Automatic cleanup of inactive connections

## Configuration

### WebSocket Endpoints
- **Health Monitoring**: `/ws/health/{user_id}`
- **DNS Management**: `/ws/dns_management/{user_id}`
- **Security Monitoring**: `/ws/security/{user_id}`
- **System Monitoring**: `/ws/system/{user_id}`
- **Admin (All Events)**: `/ws/admin/{user_id}`

### Environment Variables
- WebSocket connections automatically detect protocol (ws/wss)
