# Centralized Event Broadcasting System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive centralized event broadcasting system for the hybrid DNS server's WebSocket optimization. This system provides unified event generation, intelligent message batching, priority-based routing, and network optimization.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Types and Data Models (`app/websocket/event_types.py`)

#### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Event Types**: 60+ event types covering all DNS, security, system, and user operations
- **Event Categories**: Organized into 9 categories (Health, DNS, Security, User, System, Connection, Bulk Operation, Error, Audit, Custom)
- **Priority Levels**: 5 priority levels (Low, Normal, High, Critical, Urgent) with automatic priority assignment
- **Severity Levels**: 5 severity levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical) for logging and alerting
- **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive metadata support with correlation IDs, trace IDs, tags, and custom fields
- **Event Filtering**: Advanced filtering system with multiple criteria support
- **Batched Messages**: Support for message batching with compression and optimization

#### Event Types Supported:
```python
# Health and monitoring events
HEALTH_UPDATE, HEALTH_ALERT, FORWARDER_STATUS_CHANGE, SYSTEM_STATUS, SYSTEM_METRICS

# DNS management events  
ZONE_CREATED, ZONE_UPDATED, ZONE_DELETED, RECORD_CREATED, RECORD_UPDATED, RECORD_DELETED
BIND_RELOAD, CONFIG_CHANGE, DNS_QUERY_LOG, DNS_ANALYTICS_UPDATE

# Security events
SECURITY_ALERT, THREAT_DETECTED, RPZ_UPDATE, MALWARE_BLOCKED, PHISHING_BLOCKED

# User and session events
USER_LOGIN, USER_LOGOUT, SESSION_EXPIRED, AUTHENTICATION_FAILED

# System administration events
BACKUP_STARTED, BACKUP_COMPLETED, MAINTENANCE_STARTED, SERVICE_STARTED

# Bulk operations and progress events
BULK_OPERATION_STARTED, BULK_OPERATION_PROGRESS, IMPORT_PROGRESS, EXPORT_PROGRESS

# And many more...
```

### 2. Advanced Message Batching System (`app/websocket/message_batcher.py`)

#### Key Features:
- **Multiple Batching Strategies**: Time-based, size-based, hybrid, priority-based, and adaptive batching
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Adaptive batch sizing based on system load
- **Message Compression**: Automatic compression for messages > threshold with caching
- **Priority Bypass**: Critical events bypass batching for immediate delivery
- **Queue Management**: Per-user queues with overflow protection
- **Network Optimization**: Message optimization and compression utilities
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed performance monitoring and analytics

#### Batching Configuration:
```python
@dataclass
class BatchingConfig:
    strategy: BatchingStrategy = BatchingStrategy.HYBRID
    max_batch_size: int = 50
    max_batch_bytes: int = 64 * 1024  # 64KB
    batch_timeout_ms: int = 1000  # 1 second
    compression_enabled: bool = True
    compression_threshold: int = 1024  # Compress if > 1KB
    priority_bypass: bool = True  # Critical events bypass batching
    adaptive_sizing: bool = True
    max_queue_size: int = 1000
```

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Adjusts batch size and timeout based on system load
- **Compression Caching**: Caches compression results for repeated messages
- **Priority Queues**: Separate queues for immediate delivery of critical events
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous batch processing with error handling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired data and cache management

### 3. Enhanced Event Broadcasting Service (`app/services/enhanced_event_service.py`)

#### Key Features:
- **Centralized Event Hub**: Single point for all event generation and distribution
- **Event Persistence**: Optional database persistence with cleanup
- **Event Processing Pipeline**: Configurable event processors and filters
- **Subscription Management**: Advanced subscription system with filtering
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous event queue processing
- **Statistics and Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and performance tracking

#### Event Processing Flow:
1. **Event Creation**: Events created with automatic categorization and priority assignment
2. **Global Filtering**: Apply global filters to determine if event should be processed
3. **Persistence**: Optional database storage for audit and replay
4. **Event Processing**: Call registered event processors
5. **Broadcasting**: Route to immediate or batched delivery based on priority
6. **Delivery**: Send to WebSocket manager or message batcher

#### Statistics Tracking:
```python
{
    "events_emitted": 0,
    "events_processed": 0,
    "events_filtered": 0,
    "events_failed": 0,
    "events_batched": 0,
    "events_immediate": 0,
    "uptime_seconds": 0,
    "events_per_second": 0.0
}
```

### 4. System Integration Module (`app/websocket/integration.py`)

- **Unified System Management**: Single interface for all WebSocket system components
- **Automatic Initialization**: Handles component startup and shutdown
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for all components
- **Utility Functions**: Convenience methods for common operations

#### System Components:
- **WebSocket Manager**: Handles connections and message routing
- **Message Batcher**: Optimizes message delivery
- **Event Service**: Processes and broadcasts events

#### Usage Example:
```python
from app.websocket.integration import initialize_websocket_system

system = await initialize_websocket_system()

# Emit events
await system.emit_event(EventType.ZONE_CREATED, {"zone": "example.com"})
