**Features:**
- Critical and warning level alerts
- Performance-based alerts (response time, failure rate)
- Health status alerts (unhealthy forwarders)
- Alert filtering and acknowledgment
- Real-time alert notifications
- Detailed alert context and history

### 4. Performance Metrics ✅

**Backend Components:**
- New API endpoint: `GET /api/health/performance` with comprehensive metrics
- Performance grade calculation (excellent, good, fair, poor, critical)
- Percentile calculations (P50, P95, P99) where supported
- Per-forwarder performance tracking

**Frontend Components:**
- `frontend/src/components/health/PerformanceMetrics.tsx` - Performance dashboard
- Visual performance grades with color coding
- Comprehensive metrics display

**Features:**
- Overall system performance metrics
- Success rate and failure rate tracking
- Response time statistics (min, max, average, percentiles)
- Performance grading system
- Per-forwarder performance breakdown
- Time range filtering (1 hour to 1 week)

## New API Endpoints

### Health Monitoring Endpoints

1. **GET /api/health/history**
   - Parameters: `forwarder_id` (optional), `hours` (1-168)
   - Returns: Historical health data for charts

2. **GET /api/health/performance**
   - Parameters: `hours` (1-168)
   - Returns: Comprehensive performance metrics

3. **GET /api/health/alerts**
   - Returns: Current health alerts with severity levels

4. **GET /api/health/realtime/status**
   - Returns: WebSocket connection status and statistics

### WebSocket Endpoint

1. **WS /ws/health/{user_id}**
   - Real-time health updates
   - Automatic status change notifications
   - Ping/pong keepalive support

## Frontend Pages and Components

### New Pages
- `frontend/src/pages/HealthMonitoring.tsx` - Comprehensive health monitoring dashboard

### New Components
- `frontend/src/components/health/RealTimeHealthStatus.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/health/HealthHistoryChart.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/health/HealthAlerts.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/health/PerformanceMetrics.tsx`

### New Hooks and Contexts
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- `frontend/src/contexts/HealthMonitoringContext.tsx`

## Enhanced Features

### WebSocket Manager
- Connection management with automatic reconnection
- Message broadcasting to multiple clients
- Connection metadata tracking
- Background health update broadcasting

### Health Service Enhancements
- Performance metrics calculation
- Alert generation with configurable thresholds
- Historical data aggregation
- Status change detection and broadcasting

### Navigation Updates
- Added "Health Monitor" to main navigation
- New route: `/health`
- HeartIcon integration

## Configuration and Thresholds

### Alert Thresholds (Configurable)
```python
_alert_thresholds = {
    "response_time_warning": 200,  # ms
    "response_time_critical": 500,  # ms
    "failure_rate_warning": 0.1,  # 10%
    "failure_rate_critical": 0.3,  # 30%
    "consecutive_failures_alert": 3
}
```

### Performance Grades
- **Excellent**: 99%+ success rate, <50ms response time
- **Good**: 95%+ success rate, <100ms response time
- **Fair**: 90%+ success rate, <200ms response time
- **Poor**: 80%+ success rate
- **Critical**: <80% success rate

## Testing

A test script has been created at `backend/test_health_monitoring.py` to verify:
- WebSocket connectivity
- API endpoint functionality
- Real-time update delivery

## Usage

### Starting the Health Monitoring System

1. **Backend**: The health monitoring service starts automatically with the main application
2. **Frontend**: Navigate to `/health` to access the monitoring dashboard
3. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic WebSocket connection provides live updates

### Key Features for Users

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Real-time health status with visual indicators
2. **Historical Analysis**: Charts showing health trends over time
3. **Alert Management**: Immediate notification of issues with acknowledgment
4. **Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics and grading system
5. **Per-Forwarder Monitoring**: Individual forwarder health tracking

## Integration Points

- Integrates with existing forwarder health checking system
- Uses existing database models (ForwarderHealth)
- Leverages existing authentication system
- Compatible with existing UI components and styling

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Email/SMS alert notifications
- Custom alert threshold configuration UI
- Health monitoring for DNS zones
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Mobile-responsive health monitoring app
- Automated remediation actions

This implementation provides a comprehensive, production-ready health monitoring system that enhances the DNS server's operational visibility and reliability.
