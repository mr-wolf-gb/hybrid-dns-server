# Zone Statistics Methods Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive zone statistics methods implemented in the ZoneService class.

## Overview

The zone statistics methods provide detailed insights into DNS zone health, performance, activity, and structure. These methods support the monitoring and analytics requirements for the Hybrid DNS Server.

## Available Statistics Methods

### 1. `get_zone_statistics(zone_id: int)`

**Purpose**: Get basic statistics for a specific zone including record counts and serial information.

**Returns**:
- Zone metadata (name, type, status)
- Total record count
- Record counts by type
- Serial number information
- SOA parameters
- Creation/modification timestamps

**Usage**: Primary statistics endpoint for zone overview.

### 2. `get_zone_health_statistics(zone_id: int)`

**Purpose**: Analyze zone health and provide recommendations for optimization.

**Returns**:
- Health score (0-100)
- Health status (excellent, good, fair, poor, critical)
- List of health issues identified
- Optimization recommendations
- Days since last update

**Health Checks**:
- Presence of DNS records
- Serial number age and validity
- SOA parameter validation
- Configuration best practices

### 3. `get_zone_activity_statistics(zone_id: int, days: int = 30)`

**Purpose**: Track zone activity and modification patterns over time.

**Returns**:
- Activity metrics over specified period
- Last activity timestamp
- Activity level classification (low, medium, high)
- Modification counts (would integrate with audit logs)

**Use Cases**: 
- Identify stale zones
- Monitor zone maintenance patterns
- Track administrative activity

### 4. `get_zone_record_type_distribution(zone_id: int)`

**Purpose**: Analyze the distribution and composition of DNS record types within a zone.

**Returns**:
- Detailed breakdown by record type
- Active vs inactive record counts
- Percentage distributions
- Most common record type
- Inactive record detection

**Insights**:
- Zone composition analysis
- Record type usage patterns
- Data cleanup opportunities

### 5. `get_zone_size_statistics(zone_id: int)`

**Purpose**: Analyze zone size, complexity, and estimated resource usage.

**Returns**:
- Estimated zone file size
- Complexity level (simple, moderate, complex, very_complex)
- Size breakdown by record type
- Customization metrics (TTL, priority usage)
- Performance implications

**Applications**:
- Capacity planning
- Performance optimization
- Zone splitting recommendations

### 6. `get_zones_comparison_statistics(zone_ids: List[int])`

**Purpose**: Compare multiple zones to identify patterns and outliers.

**Returns**:
- Comparative metrics across zones
- Aggregate statistics
- Zones with most/least records
- Record type distribution across zones
- Identification of outliers

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-zone analysis
- Standardization efforts
- Resource allocation planning

### 7. `get_zones_summary()`

**Purpose**: Provide system-wide zone statistics and overview.

**Returns**:
- Total zone counts
- Active vs inactive zones
- Zones by type distribution
- Total record count across all zones

**Usage**: Dashboard overview and system health monitoring.

## API Endpoints

The following REST API endpoints expose these statistics:

- `GET /api/zones/{zone_id}/statistics` - Basic zone statistics
- `GET /api/zones/{zone_id}/statistics/health` - Zone health analysis
- `GET /api/zones/{zone_id}/statistics/activity?days=30` - Activity statistics
- `GET /api/zones/{zone_id}/statistics/records` - Record type distribution
- `GET /api/zones/{zone_id}/statistics/size` - Size and complexity analysis
- `POST /api/zones/statistics/compare` - Multi-zone comparison
- `GET /api/zones/statistics/summary` - System-wide summary

## Implementation Features

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Async/await support for non-blocking operations
- Caching-friendly data structures

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing zones
- Validation of input parameters
- Comprehensive error reporting

### Extensibility
- Modular design for easy addition of new metrics
- Configurable analysis parameters
- Integration points for audit log analysis

### Security
- User authentication required for all endpoints
- Rate limiting on comparison operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## Usage Examples

### Basic Zone Statistics
```python
zone_service = ZoneService(db)
stats = await zone_service.get_zone_statistics(zone_id=1)
print(f"Zone has {stats['total_records']} records")
```

### Health Analysis
```python
health = await zone_service.get_zone_health_statistics(zone_id=1)
if health['health_score'] < 70:
    print(f"Zone needs attention: {health['health_issues']}")
```

### Multi-Zone Comparison
```python
comparison = await zone_service.get_zones_comparison_statistics([1, 2, 3])
print(f"Average records per zone: {comparison['comparison']['average_records_per_zone']}")
```

## Integration Points
