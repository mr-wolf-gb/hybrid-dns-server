- `GET /api/forwarders/{id}/health` - Health details
- `POST /api/forwarders/health/refresh` - Refresh health

### Database Schema
Enhanced forwarder model should include:
- `response_time` - Latest response time
- `query_count` - Total queries processed
- `success_rate` - Success rate percentage
- `last_health_check` - Timestamp of last check

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Type Safety
