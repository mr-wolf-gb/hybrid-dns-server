# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current WebSocket implementation in the hybrid DNS server uses multiple connections per user (one for each connection type: health, dns_management, security, system, admin). This approach creates unnecessary overhead, complexity, and resource consumption. The goal is to optimize the WebSocket system to use a single, unified connection per user while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new features for better real-time communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single WebSocket Connection Per User

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use only one WebSocket connection per user, so that server resources are optimized and connection management is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the WebSocket system THEN the system SHALL establish only one WebSocket connection per authenticated user
2. WHEN a user attempts to create multiple connections THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing connection instead of creating new ones
3. WHEN the single connection is established THEN the system SHALL support all event types that were previously handled by separate connections
4. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL clean up the single connection and all associated resources

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Event Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to dynamically subscribe and unsubscribe from different event types on the same connection, so that I can control what data the client receives without creating new connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a subscription request THEN the system SHALL add the requested event types to the user's subscription list
2. WHEN a client sends an unsubscription request THEN the system SHALL remove the specified event types from the user's subscription list
3. WHEN an event occurs THEN the system SHALL only send the event to users who are subscribed to that event type
4. WHEN a user's subscription changes THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation message with the updated subscription list
5. WHEN a user connects THEN the system SHALL provide a default subscription based on user role and permissions

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Message Routing and Filtering

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want intelligent message routing that filters events based on user permissions and subscriptions, so that users only receive relevant data they are authorized to see.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is broadcast THEN the system SHALL check user permissions before sending the event
2. WHEN a user has admin role THEN the system SHALL allow subscription to all event types
3. WHEN a user has regular role THEN the system SHALL restrict access to admin-only events
4. WHEN an event contains sensitive data THEN the system SHALL filter the data based on user permissions
5. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch and optimize message delivery

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Streaming Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want real-time updates to be delivered efficiently with minimal latency, so that I can monitor system status and DNS operations in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DNS queries are processed THEN the system SHALL stream query logs in real-time to subscribed users
2. WHEN system metrics change THEN the system SHALL send updates at configurable intervals (default 30 seconds)
3. WHEN critical events occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications with high priority
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL implement message queuing and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN data volume is high THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and data aggregation

### Requirement 5: Connection Health and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust connection health monitoring and automatic recovery, so that WebSocket connections remain stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL implement heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism
2. WHEN a connection becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN reconnection fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide manual reconnection options
4. WHEN server restarts THEN the system SHALL handle graceful disconnection and automatic client reconnection
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh or redirect to login

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Event Types and Data

**User Story:** As a DNS administrator, I want comprehensive real-time events for all DNS operations and system changes, so that I can monitor and respond to issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DNS records are modified THEN the system SHALL broadcast detailed change events with before/after data
2. WHEN BIND9 configuration changes THEN the system SHALL send configuration update events
3. WHEN forwarder health changes THEN the system SHALL send health status updates with detailed metrics
4. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate security alerts
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL send progress updates and completion notifications

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed WebSocket performance metrics and analytics, so that I can monitor system health and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are active THEN the system SHALL track connection count, message throughput, and latency metrics
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
3. WHEN administrators request statistics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time WebSocket performance data
4. WHEN message queues grow large THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement backpressure
5. WHEN connections exceed limits THEN the system SHALL implement fair resource allocation and connection limiting

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new WebSocket system to be backward compatible with existing frontend code, so that the migration is seamless and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing frontend code connects THEN the system SHALL support legacy connection patterns during transition
2. WHEN legacy event handlers are used THEN the system SHALL route events to maintain compatibility
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear deprecation warnings for old patterns
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain API consistency with existing patterns
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and migration guidance
