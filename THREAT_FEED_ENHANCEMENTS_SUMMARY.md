- **Health Indicators**: Visual health status for each feed

#### UI Components Added:
- Statistics overview cards
- Health metrics dashboard
- Update schedule timeline
- Custom domain list editor
- Recommendations panel

### 2. New ThreatFeedStatistics Component (`frontend/src/components/security/ThreatFeedStatistics.tsx`)

#### Features:
- **Real-time Statistics**: Auto-refreshing statistics display
- **Health Scoring**: Visual health score indicators
- **Category Breakdown**: Rules categorized by threat type
- **Update Analytics**: 24-hour update success/failure metrics
- **Feed Details Table**: Comprehensive feed information

### 3. Enhanced API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)

#### New Methods:
- `getThreatFeedStatistics()` - Fetch comprehensive statistics
- `getThreatFeedSchedule()` - Get update schedule
- `scheduleThreatFeedUpdates()` - Trigger scheduled updates
- `createCustomThreatList()` - Create custom lists
- `updateCustomThreatList()` - Update custom lists

## Key Capabilities Implemented
